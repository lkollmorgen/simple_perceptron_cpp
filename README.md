####
### Summary
This project showcases a c++ class implementation of a simple perceptron with a sample usage
## Usage
_in /Test:_
```
make all 
```

## Updates
7/29:
- created directories
- `s_percept.h` class outline
- included single layer perceptron sample dataset
- began class method implementaion in `source_s_percept.cpp` 

8/1:
- updated makefiles for cleaning objects/executables
- began implementation of read_data in `source_s_percept.cpp`
    - functionality to gather size of vector from .csv
## TODO
- functionality to read _features, _targets
